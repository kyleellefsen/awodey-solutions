First of all, the underlying graph cannot contain any cycles, since any cycle is a path that can be composed with itself infinitely, resulting in infinitely many arrows.

Then there cannot be more than 6 nodes + edges since each node admits an identity arrow to itself. This gives us a path to a solution by enumerating all (finitely many) non-isomorphic directed acyclic graphs with $|V| + |E| <= 6$.

Doing this for all possible number of nodes, we get:

0. 0 nodes generates the empty category, which has no arrows.
1. With 1 node our only option is to have no edges, since we can't have a loop, which generates the singleton category.
2. With 2 nodes our only option is to have a single edge from one node to the other, generating the category of three arrows considered in Problem 1-9(a).
3. We get just one graph whose free category has 6 arrows:

  $
    #diagram(
      $star \ star edge("u", <-) edge(->)  & star$
    )
  $

  Its category has 5 arrows directly from the graph, and exactly one additionally from the path from the topmost arrow to the rightmost one.

4. We have the following three graphs on four nodes:

  $
    #align(horizon)[
      #grid(
        columns: (auto, auto, auto),
        rows: (auto),
        row-gutter: 16pt,
        column-gutter: 48pt,

        diagram(
          $star & star \ star edge(->) edge("u", ->)  & star$
        ),
        diagram(
          $star & star \ star edge(<-) edge("u", <-)  & star$
        ),
        diagram(
          $star & star \ star edge("u", <-)  & star edge("u", <-)$
        ),
      )
    ]
  $

  To cut back on checking, we can notice first that there can be at most two edges (by the above logic $|V| + |E| <= 6$). If there are two edges, there are going to be two disconnected graphs, either of order 3 or 2. If 3, the size 3 subgraph has to end up being as a free category with 5 arrows, all of whom we enumerated while working through case (3). If 2, there is only one possibility enumerated last above. The case of one edge yields only 5 morphisms, and no edges yields only 4.
5. There is just one such graph, namely

  $
    #diagram(
      $star & star & star \ star edge("u", <-)  & star$
    ),
  $

  We can conclude this by noticing there can be at most one edge, and any such choice forces the above graph (up to isomorphism). There cannot be no edge since this yields just five morphisms.
6. With 6 nodes we must not select any edges since then we'd have more than 6 arrows. This gives us a single option, the discrete category of 6 elements:

  $
    #diagram(
      $star & star & star \ star & star & star$
    )
  $
